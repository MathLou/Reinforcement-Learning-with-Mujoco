# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Mujoco
A repository for studies with Mujoco and reinforcement learning frameworks
Here you will find a case study with furuta pendulum with stable baselines 3

Requirements: gymnasium, stable_baselines_3, mujoco

* To train Furuta pendulum, use ´´´furuta_env.py´´´
* To evaluate trained model, just run ´´´render.py´´´ with your trained model
* To check ideal scenario, just run ´´´control_furuta.py´´´ to check ideal model behavior (PID tuned model)
